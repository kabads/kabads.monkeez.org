<div>What is more, this government wants to &#39;reign in&#39; public sector pensions to prevent rising costs to the taxpayer, but at the same time, offers a reduction in tax for those earning the most (the 50% rate). Why should hard working teachers, nurses, ambulance drivers pay up more for their pension, when the most wealthy in society are receiving a tax break? </p>
<p>Are we all in this together, or, has Cameron finally revealed the true colours of the Tory-led government? </p></div>
