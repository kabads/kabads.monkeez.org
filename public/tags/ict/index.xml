      <description>I introduced Edmodo to my ICT club this afternoon and they enjoyed it. Basically, it&#39;s an online learning environment that is private to you and your groups. You give your children a code when they sign up which enrols them on your course automatically. The children found it difficult to find a username that hadn&#39;t already been chosen, but after some perseverance they all got on, children from year 3 to year 6.</description>
