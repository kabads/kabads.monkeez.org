  RAID disks offer particular advantages over ordinary single disk set up. Data redundancy is improved (consider it to be a continuous backup) and also significant performance can be seen with the correct configuration.
There are different types of RAID levels and each level will need to be chosen on a use-case:
 RAID 0: Uses only striping - this makes two disks appear like one larger disk. Provides a performance boost when accessing disks.

  What are the advantages of Logical Volume Management (LVM)?
LVM treats your physical harddrives as &lsquo;elastic&rsquo; storage - that is extents can be across disks allowing filesystems to be across many disks and/or partitions. This allows a lot of flexibility and can allow filesystems to shrink or grow easily.
There is a small disadvantage when using LVM - there is an overhead when reading and writing to disk - which doesn&rsquo;t normally happen when writing to a normal block disk.

  The problem? School&rsquo;s are facing dwindling education budgets and yet increasing expectations for children&rsquo;s attainment in their knowledge. They are expected to deliver a better educational experience for less money (per head). How could they possibly do this, knowing that even now they are challenged with their budgets?
When people pick up new technology they usually have to learn how to use the device - this is included in new operating systems that are released.

  So, not many people have heard about the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership agreement -aka TTIP - and it isn&rsquo;t receiving much coverage from the BBC or other news outlets.
However, this cartoon shows pretty much what is going on.

  Amazon yesterday released the prime music service in the UK. This came at a particularly useful time for me as I&rsquo;m currently not working and so have quite a bit of time to play with it. I have used spotify in the past, but not regularly as I don&rsquo;t get as much time to listen to music as I would like.
The web interface immediately pushed me to their playlists, which this service seems to rely on heavily.

  I&rsquo;ve made the switch from Wordpress, which has been a great open source project, to Jekyll. I switched host and found that my old wordpress system was just too slow. I wanted something fast. I wanted something geeky. My host charges me for the amount of processing power and I found that my prepaid amount was going down fast (and I am pretty much the only person who uses this site).

  David Cameron wants to ban encryption. He thinks that the government needs to have a copy of all our communications to ensure safety. It&rsquo;s a strange concept. Most day-to-day transactions rely on some form of encryption. So, those transactions might become jeopardized, or even illegal.
I am interested in how secure this keeps our country. What evidence exists to show that these interventions by government can prevent terrorism. I&rsquo;m sure there are individuals who will use some forms of electronic devices to arrange illegal activities (and even sometimes lethal activities).

  So, I&rsquo;ve set myself a target of running 1000km this year. I realised a couple of months ago that I&rsquo;ve run quite a lot this year. I got to June and had run more than any other year before. So, the idea is to keep running and get to 1000km (621 miles) by December.
