      <description>Sunday involved a train ride to bath with a Brompton in fold, and then cycling around the Two Tunnels circular route. A quick stop at The Hope and Anchor pub to avoid the sleet and get a quick half-way coffee, is highly recommended.</description>

      <description>This afternoon, I met up with a few friends at a local pub. It was great catching up with everyone, but what also great was that afterwards, I planned to cycle some 15km to one of the largest hills around. I wanted to see what it was like to climb roughly 150m up a hill. And find out, I did. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make it all the way to the top without stopping, but I got to the top with one break just near the top.</description>
