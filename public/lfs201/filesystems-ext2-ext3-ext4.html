The ext family of filesystems have been native to Linux since its earliest days, and have been the most widely used of the choices available. Until very recently, ext4 was the most frequent default choice of linux distributions, due to its excellent combination of performance, integrity and stability.

<p>
The ext2 filesystem was Linux's original native variety and is available on all linux systems, but is rarely used today. 
The ext3 filesystem was the first journalling extension of ext2. It had the same on-disk layout as ext2 except for the presence of a journal file. 
The ext4 filesystem first appeared in kernel version 2.6.19 and its experimental designation was removed in version 2.6.28. It included significant enhancements such as the use of extents for large files, instead of list of file blocks. 
An extent is simply a group of contiguous blocks. Using them can improve large file performance and reduce fragmentation. 
ext4 is the default filesystem on most enterprise linux distributions, although RHEL 7 has recently adopted XFS as the default.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Ext4 features</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
There is a close correspondence of features between VFS and ext2/3/4 filesystems as each has been designed with the other in mind. 
Block size is selected when the filesystem is built - it can be
512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes. By default, 4096 is usually used for hard disk systems unless the partition is very small. Unless there are very many small files, larger block sizes can be more efficient in terms of minimizing hard disk access. 
The linux kernel memory management system requires only an integral number of blocks must fit into a page of memory; thus you can not have 8KB blocks on an x86 platform where pages of memory are 4KB in size. 
The number of inodes on the filesystem can also be tuned, which may save disk space. 
A feature called an inode reservation consists of reserving several inodes when a directory is created, expecting them to be used in the future. This improves performance, because when new files are created the directory already has inodes allocated. 
If the pathname of a symbolic link is less than 60 characters, a so-called fast symbolic link is created, which is stored directly in the inode, obviating the need to read a data block. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Ext4 layout</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
All fields are written to disk in little-endian order, except the journal. 
Disk blocks are partitioned in to block groups, each of which contains inode and data blocks stored adjacently, thereby lowering access time. 
The layout of a standard block group is simple. For block group 0, the first 1024 bytes are unused (to allow for boot sectors, etc). The superblock will start at the first block, except for group 0. This is followed by the group descriptors and a number of GDT (Global Descriptor Table) blocks. These are followed by the data block bitmap, the inode bitmap, the inode table, and the data blocks. 
Data blocks are pre-allocated to files before they are actually used. Thus when a file's size is increased, adjacent space has already been reserved and file fragmentation is reduced. 
The filesystem superblock contains bit-fields which are used to ascertain whether or not the filesystem requires checking when it is first mounted during system initialization. The status can be: 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-4-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.1</span> clean: filesystem cleanly unmounted previously</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-4-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.2</span> dirty: usually means mounted</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-4-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.3</span> unknown: not cleanly unmounted, such as when there is a system crash</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-3">
<p>
In the latter two cases fsck will be run to check the filesystem and fix any problems before it is mounted. 
Other fields in the superblock contain information about when the filesystem was last checked, both in date and number of mounts, and automatic checking is triggered when tuneable limits are exceeded for these quantaties. 
The first block on the filesystem is the so-called boot block, and is reserved for the partition boot sector.

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Block groups</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
After the boot block there is a series of block groups, each of which is the same size. The layout of each block group is given in the following figure: 
</p>

<td class="left">Data block bitmap</td>
<td class="left">Inode bitmap</td>
<td class="left">Inode table (n blocks)</td>
<td class="left">Data blocks (n groups)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
The first and second blocks are the same in every block group, and compromise the Superblock and the Group Descriptors. Under normal circumstances only those in the first block group are used by the kernel; the duplicate copies are only referenced when the filesystem is being checked. If everything is OK, the kernel merely copies them over from the first block group. If there is a problem with the master copies, it goes to the next and so on until a healthy one is found and the filesystem structure is rebuilt. This redundancy makes it very difficult to thoroughly fry an ext2/3/4 filesystem, as long as the filesystem checks are run periodically. 
In early incarnations of the ext filesystem family, each block group contained the group descriptors for every block group, as well as a copy of the super block. As an optimization, however, today not all block groups have a copy of the superblock and group descriptors. To see what you have you could try: 
$ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 |grep superblock
(putting in appropriate device node) to see precise locations. This happens when the filesystem is created with the sparse<sub>super</sub> option, which is the default. 
The number of block groups is constrained by the fact that the block bitmap, which identifies used and free blocks within the group, has to fit in a single block. Thus, if a block is 4096 bytes in size, a block group can contain no more than 32 K blocks, or 128 MB. If we take the largest possible block group size, a 10 GB patition would thus have to have at least 80 block groups. 
The block allocator tries to keep each file's blocks within the same block group to reduce seek times.

<p>
The data block and inode bitmaps are blocks whose bits contain 0 for each free block or inode and 1 for each used one. There is only one of each of these bitmaps per block group. 
The inode table contains as many consecutive blocks as are necessary to cover the number of inodes in the block group. Each inode requires 128 bytes; thus a 4kb block can contain 32 inodes. The ext2<sub>inode</sub> data structure is also given in include/linux/ext2 fs.h. 
Note that there is space reserved for some operating system dependent information; different OSs could possibly mount an ext2/3 filesystem, much as linux can mount many different kinds of non-native filesystems. 
Note that the inode number itself is not stored on the disk in this structure, but rather its value can be quickly calculated from the block number and offset within the inode table. 
The ext2 and ext3 filesystems did not yet incorporate the use of extents to organize larger files. Instead, the i<sub>block[]</sub> array of pointers to data blocks, of length EXT2<sub>N</sub><sub>BLOCKS</sub>=15, is described by the inode. The way this is handled is somewhat complex:

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-2">
<p>
This algorithm makes addressing small files go fastest, as it should. For instance, with a 4KB block size, a 48KB file can be directly addressed, a 2MB file requires a second-order process, a 1GB a third-order, a 4GB file a fourth-order.

<h4 id="sec-1-10-4"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.4</span> Splits large files into the largest possible extents instead of using indirect block mapping. This can improve large file performance and reduce fragmentation.</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-5"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.5</span> Uses multiblock allocation which can allocate space all at once instead of one block at a time. In addition, delayed allocation can also increase performance.</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-6"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.6</span> Can pre-allocate disk space for a file. The allocated space is usually both guaranteed and contiguous.</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-7"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.7</span> Uses allocate-on-flush, a performance technique which delays block allocation until data is written to disk.</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-8"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.8</span> Uses fast fsck which can make the speed of a filesystem check go up by an order of magnitude or more.</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-9"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.9</span> Uses checksums for the journal which improves reliability. This can also safely avoid a disk I/O wait during journalling, resulting in a slight performance boost.</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-10" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-10"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.10</span> Uses improved timestamps measured in nanoseconds</h4>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10-11" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-10-11"><span class="section-number-4">1.10.11</span> Includes snapshot support.</h4>
