      <description>Amazon Web Services allows you to spin up instances very quickly. This how to will show you how to upload your content to a S3 bucket and then launch an instance that pulls that content in and starts Apache to serve that content.
Initially, you will need to create a role under IAM. This will have to be able to access S3, so create the role, choose which service you would like to associate it with.</description>

      <title>AWS - How to Create A VPC</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2017/09/20/how-to-create-a-vpc/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2017/09/20/how-to-create-a-vpc/</guid>
      <description>AWS allows you to create your own virtual private cloud (or VPC). This is a network within which your machines will communicate. You can control the level of access across your VPC through subnets, Network Access Control Lists and Security Groups.
Network Access Control lists allow particular traffic in and outbound, but are stateless; that is, if you allow traffic in, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that traffic will leave the network.</description>

      <description>Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows you to serve private network traffic from behind a public load balancer. This offers extra security benefits as it detects DDOS traffic and other exploits and offers a layer of protection.
There are some things you should know before you start this tutorial. You should know:
 How to create a VPC How to configure subnets How to create an EC2 instance How to ensure an EC2 instance is within an particular subnet How to ssh to an EC2 instance  You will create a new VPC.</description>

      <description>TADS - Teresa, Adam, Dave and Shep walking. We have been walking for about 2 years now, all around the South East. This was our longest walk by far in two days. Swindon to Goring.
The walk started out with us meeting at Swindon having lunch. There seemed to be quite a lot going on in the town with Canadian flags and guys at the train station with Ice Hockey sticks.</description>

      <description>With the demise of Cyanogenmod and CyanogenOS people who like to keep a cheaper phone up to date will have to familiarise themselves with LineageOS. This is the fork of the latest version where CyanogenMod left off. As the company shutdown, users are left with no updates. LineageOS will resolve this for you.
It had been a while (8 months) since installing a new custom ROM, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so familiar with the TWRP recovery boot process.</description>

      <description>Amazon have provided a pretty neat infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). By using this as a platform, you can quickly scale up and down provisioned resources. At times, you may experience peak demand, and AWS will allow you to respond with this. At other times, you can scale your resources down.
The first step in learning about this platform, is running an EC2 instance. This is the &amp;lsquo;machine&amp;rsquo; behind your service.</description>

      <title>Finding large files in a directory</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2016/11/20/finding-large-files-in-a-directory/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2016/11/20/finding-large-files-in-a-directory/</guid>
      <description>I have directories that agedu shows as having large files. However, agedu doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell me what the names of the files are.
A quick find will sort that
 Run this, and you will have a file called bigfiles.txt that has the size in bytes and the filename. This does not work recursively, with the flag -maxdepth 1 preventing that.</description>

      <title>How to download newspapers with Calibre and deliver to your Kindle</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2016/08/25/downloading-newspaper-using-calibre/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2016/08/25/downloading-newspaper-using-calibre/</guid>
      <description>So, I have read a few pages which outline how to do this, but none seem to sum all of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve set up my Raspberry to download a newspaper and then deliver it daily to my Kindle. I paid for a subscription (in fact, I pay for more than one subscription) so I feel entitled to do this, as I&amp;rsquo;m supporting the journalists financially.
Firstly, you will need to install Calibre.</description>

      <description>Trip to Cuba Having gone to one of the best destinations I&amp;rsquo;ve probably ever been to, I felt the need to document it in a more formal way. I was inspired by the Cuban culture and vibrant life to record some of the sights I&amp;rsquo;d seen.
I like the achitecture of buildings. Once they were part of the finery of Havana, but since then, people don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to upkeep this kind of large building, hence its appearance.</description>

      <description>This afternoon, I met up with a few friends at a local pub. It was great catching up with everyone, but what also great was that afterwards, I planned to cycle some 15km to one of the largest hills around. I wanted to see what it was like to climb roughly 150m up a hill. And find out, I did. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make it all the way to the top without stopping, but I got to the top with one break just near the top.</description>

      <title>Using sed</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2016/02/20/using-sed/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2016/02/20/using-sed/</guid>
      <description>sed is a quick command line utility to change text within a file, or input stream. Typically, it is used within a pipe situation (i.e. using the character | on the command line). If you are not familiar with that command, you will need to research that before continuing.
A simple use of sed is to replace characters in a stream or file. This is done using regular expressions. This will help you search for a set of characters and then replace them with the alternative.</description>

      <description>Find command I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the find command simply since I can remember, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really got to see the true power of this command. Combined with the -exec flag this command can throw up a lot of different uses. -exec allows you to work with other bash commands and operate on them.
A basic use would look like this:
$ find . -name &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; -type f -size +10M -exec rm {} \;  Let&amp;rsquo;s break this down.</description>

      <description>Uses Firewalls allow only particular access to particular network ports and paths. You can remove access to a port or a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses.
Admins can apply rules according to what access they would like - these rules include both outgoing and incoming network traffic. This allows admins to build barriers of trust across machines.
Modern firewalls are based on Application Layer Firewalls and are aware of the kinds of applications and protocols that the connection is using.</description>

      <title>How to enable disk quotas for users</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/12/22/how-to-enable-disk-quotas-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/12/22/how-to-enable-disk-quotas-linux/</guid>
      <description>Uses Linux allows setting quotas on a filesystem. This will prevent users from using more diskspace than they are allowed. This can also be used to manage group allowances to enforce the allowance for a collection of users. Stopping users from filling up a diskspace can be an important on a shared system as filling up a physical disk drive can bring a system down, or make it unstable.</description>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/12/05/encrypt-a-partition/</guid>
      <description>Introduction An encrypted partition can add a layer of security to your system. When initialized, it will ask for the passphrase which, if unavailable, will not allow proper mounting. This renders the information on the drive as unreadable.
Most systems use the Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS for short) format for encryption and this can be a standard install for most distribution.
Steps for setting up LUKS Setting up the drive Firstly you should have a partition drive that is unmounted and unformatted (no filesystem).</description>

      <title>How and why you should be using 2 factor authentication</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/10/31/how-and-why-2-factor-authentication/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/10/31/how-and-why-2-factor-authentication/</guid>
      <description>Two factor authentication provides another layer of security to any sign in for services you use. By enabling 2 factor authentication, you are using another layer of security when signing in. However, this extra layer of security is a physical one, not necessarily digital. The 2 factor authentication requires a particular object which cannot be replicated. This can be the form of a USB key or a mobile phone. Banks have used this before with card readers which produce a particular code.</description>

      <title>Linux group explained</title>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/10/18/groups-explained/</guid>
      <description>Users on a linux system belong to at least one group. Groups allow a systems administrator to create parts of the filesystem where a group of users can share files. They also allow a group of users to access particular commands or resources on the system, that other users might not be able to access.
Groups are defined in the /etc/group file, which is only root writeable.
To create a group, the groupadd command is used.</description>

      <title>Using Git as a content manager system</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/09/10/using-git-as-content-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/09/10/using-git-as-content-manager/</guid>
      <description>Not familiar with git? Start with an online book or Version Control with Git.
Git is an open sourced source control software system. It allows coders to manage large projects remotely and on their own machine. Each contributor will hold their own version of the code on their machine and can manipulate that however they wish. Eventually, they can push back their contributions to a remote repository.
This workflow design can also be great for managing content, although that content does have to be in text format - git will allow binary files to be uploaded and managed, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for differences between files to be shown - this can only be done with plain text files.</description>

      <description>RAID disks offer particular advantages over ordinary single disk set up. Data redundancy is improved (consider it to be a continuous backup) and also significant performance can be seen with the correct configuration.
There are different types of RAID levels and each level will need to be chosen on a use-case:
 RAID 0: Uses only striping - this makes two disks appear like one larger disk. Provides a performance boost when accessing disks.</description>

      <title>How to set-up LVM on Linux</title>
      <link>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/08/21/how-to-set-up-lvm-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://kabads.monkeez.org/2015/08/21/how-to-set-up-lvm-linux/</guid>
      <description>What are the advantages of Logical Volume Management (LVM)?
LVM treats your physical harddrives as &amp;lsquo;elastic&amp;rsquo; storage - that is extents can be across disks allowing filesystems to be across many disks and/or partitions. This allows a lot of flexibility and can allow filesystems to shrink or grow easily.
There is a small disadvantage when using LVM - there is an overhead when reading and writing to disk - which doesn&amp;rsquo;t normally happen when writing to a normal block disk.</description>

      <description>The problem? School&amp;rsquo;s are facing dwindling education budgets and yet increasing expectations for children&amp;rsquo;s attainment in their knowledge. They are expected to deliver a better educational experience for less money (per head). How could they possibly do this, knowing that even now they are challenged with their budgets?
When people pick up new technology they usually have to learn how to use the device - this is included in new operating systems that are released.</description>

      <description>Amazon yesterday released the prime music service in the UK. This came at a particularly useful time for me as I&amp;rsquo;m currently not working and so have quite a bit of time to play with it. I have used spotify in the past, but not regularly as I don&amp;rsquo;t get as much time to listen to music as I would like.
The web interface immediately pushed me to their playlists, which this service seems to rely on heavily.</description>

My host charges me for the amount of processing power and I found that my prepaid amount was going down fast (and I am pretty much the only person who uses this site).</description>

      <description>David Cameron wants to ban encryption. He thinks that the government needs to have a copy of all our communications to ensure safety. It&amp;rsquo;s a strange concept. Most day-to-day transactions rely on some form of encryption. So, those transactions might become jeopardized, or even illegal.
I am interested in how secure this keeps our country. What evidence exists to show that these interventions by government can prevent terrorism. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are individuals who will use some forms of electronic devices to arrange illegal activities (and even sometimes lethal activities).</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve set myself a target of running 1000km this year. I realised a couple of months ago that I&amp;rsquo;ve run quite a lot this year. I got to June and had run more than any other year before. So, the idea is to keep running and get to 1000km (621 miles) by December.</description>

      <description>My first arduino project.
Basically, when you turn the potentiometer one way, the led blinks slower, and when you turn it the other way, it blinks faster.
It needs a video to explain.</description>

      <description>William Hague claims if you haven&#39;t done anything wrong, you shouldn&#39;t care about your privacy. So why does the Govt. claim to need to present evidence in a secret court with evidence related to illegal kidnapping?

      <description>Dave&#39;s latest message, http://cur.lv/e3wr which is frighteningly reassuring, gives us the message that &#39;we&#39;re doing the right thing&#39; - this is a global race, that we must keep up with.
However, you need to delve behind what he&#39;s saying. Basically, this is a global race and we need to keep up with other countries. These countries being China and India. However, our economies are completely different from these manufacturing countries. China&#39;s economy has been fueled by becoming the world&#39;s manufacturing centre - we gave this industry up some 20 years ago instead favouring an information driven economy.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve just got the VPS bug. A VPS is a virtual private server, which means you get root access to a server of your choice at a very low cost (as opposed to a dedicated server).
I&#39;ve managed to get some pretty cheap deals which manage services that I used to run in my house (using computers up and valuable space).
One of the servers now runs my media and another (my favourite) runs minecraft (www.</description>

      <description>Over at the New Statesman, they&#39;ve identified the problem that the current government faces.
Two years ago, whilst in opposition, they were very wary of Labour&#39;s surveillance plans to monitor the public&#39;s behaviour online. However, now they are in government, they want to do the same. http://monki.biz/2k
Why the change? What is it about pledges that are made before an election is held and then once power is assumed? Why do politicians think we don&#39;t remember these pledges and easily break them just a few months into their term in government?</description>

      <description>When Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a recent match one jerk, named Liam Stacey, started tweeting racist abuse. Muamba wasn&amp;#39;t aware of this, as he was unconscious and being resuscitated. However, the judicial system rightly saw this racist behaviour as worthy for the perpetrator to serve time in prison. However, when a young black person was stopped by the police and racially abused, and recorded that abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service deemed it unnecessary to bring any charges against the police officer because the victim didn&amp;#39;t suffer any distress from the racist behaviour.</description>

      <description>Not many people would know it today, as the media has not really picked up on it (apart from the Guardian) - but teachers in London were on strike today. They are asking for their pensions to be protected as they are well funded and the current coalition government has refused to carry out a review of how well the pensions are funded, which should happen every 4 years.  Whilst parents will be annoyed that their children have had to have a day off, would they support a reduction in their own working practices, or would they fight for what they agreed to when they started the job?</description>

      <description>Teachers will have to contribute 50% more to their pensions over the next three years at a time when top earners can look forward to a cut in the 50p top rate of tax, said Blower.

      <description>Back in 2009 Cameron vowed to open government to the masses (&#34;We will begin a massive redistribution of power in our country, from the powerful to the powerless, from the political elite to the man and the woman in the street.&#34; - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8067505.stm) and yet he refuses to disclose which big donors have been for dinner - (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17508271).
Is this really the &#34;massive redistribution of power&#34; that we were expecting? Do we really now feel this redistribution of power?</description>

      <description>I introduced Edmodo to my ICT club this afternoon and they enjoyed it. Basically, it&#39;s an online learning environment that is private to you and your groups. You give your children a code when they sign up which enrols them on your course automatically. The children found it difficult to find a username that hadn&#39;t already been chosen, but after some perseverance they all got on, children from year 3 to year 6.</description>

      <description>Report easy has another buyer - who purchased it yesterday. I was surprised when I got my first buy, but have been surprised that other people have joined in. It&#39;s early days and I&#39;ve still made a loss on the whole venture, but the fact that people think my software has real value that they are prepared to pay for, is even more surprising.&amp;nbsp;
I put up a video on youtube of the video to show people what it looks like when they are using it, which I think is the selling point.</description>

      <description>http://monki.biz/1r Publishing is a tough industry to be in, no doubt about it. Things are rapidly changing and market forces are being swayed beyond the traditional publisher&#39;s influence. Things are now so easy to share and distribute, that these old gate-keepers can no longer steer what people are looking at.
However, e-books are being subjected to this, so that instead of paper being pushed around and controlled, &amp;nbsp;instead digital files are being controlled and again, authors are being expected to go through the publisher, instead of dealing directly with their audience.</description>

      <description>Took a couple of shots this frosty morning and then the battery ran out. I&amp;#39;ll have to take some more once it&amp;#39;s recharged. The birdfeeders are a lot more active now, so I should get some more active shots.   See the full gallery on Posterous   </description>

      <description>The film soylent green is about people being harvested for food. That&amp;#39;s how I see Facebook. Your details are being harvested for business and advertising. Sure, it can be beneficial to stay in touch with each other, but there&amp;#39;s a bigger price to pay. I&amp;#39;ve come to the decision that the amount of information I&amp;#39;m getting from other people isn&amp;#39;t worth the price I&amp;#39;m paying for that lack of privacy and having my details flogged to advertisers.</description>

      <description>  stopped on my way home to take this shot
I wish I&#39;d taken longer to take it, but it was on a narrow road. It captures the sense of what I wanted. I&#39;ll see if I can get a more please shot another day.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>I&#39;ve been working on a little side project to learn programming (this is the year of coding apparently).&amp;nbsp;
http://www.reporteasy.co.uk
This is a little application that assists with writing pupil reports for teachers - it automates a lot of the text entry that often takes a long time.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>I&#39;ve signed up to google music - not sure if I like the way spotify is going. I don&#39;t like having to have a facebook account (not that I had one when I initially signed up) and I don&#39;t like the way spotify are going about publishing details about my music preferences even though I haven&#39;t signed up for it.&amp;nbsp;
So, for a while - goodbye spotify and hello google music.</description>
