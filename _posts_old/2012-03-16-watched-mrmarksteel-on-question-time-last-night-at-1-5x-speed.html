<div class="posterous_autopost">Well, I didn&#39;t really watch all of it at 1.5x speed - I watched everyone else at that speed and Mark Steel at normal speed. It really livened up the other boring panelists. Mr Steel came out of it brilliantly and made very good comments.
<p />
<div>I was impressed with his argument about the government promoting the &#39;lower classes&#39; picking on each other, about a benefits cap, which will save a few million whilst the super rich walk away with all the profits, with corporations doing deals with the HMRC and avoiding £25bn . If you didn&#39;t see it you should try and find it - I may even upload it to youtube myself if I get time. </div>
