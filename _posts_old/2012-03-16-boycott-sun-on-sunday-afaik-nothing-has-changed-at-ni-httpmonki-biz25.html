<div class="posterous_autopost">Tomorrow the Sun on Sunday will be released, but according to these documents (<a href="http://monki.biz/25">http://monki.biz/25</a>) they requested that sensitive data and emails be deleted during investigations in to phone hacking. The question is, what has changed at News International? The public have a right to know that this organisation has the checks in place to prevent things like this happening again.Â
