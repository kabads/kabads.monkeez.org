<div class="posterous_autopost">This article describes some of the things that politicians are discussing to enforce ACTA throughout countries. Basically it will prove the end of free internet, with websites being taken down for copyright infringement - this will mean that anyone who is accused of something that infringes a protected format (e.g. a DVD that has been encrypted and the user wants to watch it on a free and open source operating system) can be prosecuted. 
<p />
<div>Also, there are cases where judges plainly do not understand the technology that is at play here - see <a href="http://monki.biz/1p">http://monki.biz/1p</a> for more information. </div>
<p />
<div>Anyway, read the article and contact your politician to complain - if you reside in the UK you can use this example letter <a href="http://pastebin.com/FUSdnSLB">http://pastebin.com/FUSdnSLB</a> and post it to  <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">http://www.writetothem.com/</a>. </div>
