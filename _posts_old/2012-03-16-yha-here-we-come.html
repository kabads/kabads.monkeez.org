<div class="posterous_autopost">We&#39;ve joined the Youth Hostel Association and are planning some trips over the Easter Holiday. We&#39;re off to a Bristol and then off to the Brecons to see some mountains. Pretty cheap accommodation and nice locations - feeling quite excited about it already.Â </div>
