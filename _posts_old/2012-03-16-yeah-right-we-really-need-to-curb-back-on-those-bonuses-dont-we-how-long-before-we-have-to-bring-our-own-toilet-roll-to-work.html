<p>This article states the government's intentions to curb back the bonus culture, whereby people are awarded monetary rewards for failure:&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then this article, some 12 days later states that this guy is worth nearly &pound;1m for good performance despite the share price of Royal Bank of Scotland being worse than when the guy took over. This is a company that is 80% owned by the UK government. They get to decide how much he should be paid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, is this rewarding failure, or something different?</p>
<p>If you feel strongly about this, you can sign a petition to stop tax payer's money being directly used to fund a Director's bonus.&nbsp;</p>
