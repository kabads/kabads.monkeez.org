<div class="posterous_autopost">This article <a href="http://monki.biz/1u">http://monki.biz/1u</a> describes how we are feeding the big brother of the future. Interesting idea - and we are doing it willingly with the thoughts that it is more beneficial. Will this change? I doubt it - as long as people are kept in the dark about the business model and just sold the idea of sharing, I think it will succeed  - but when will the boundaries be set? When will medical healthcare be withdrawn because a lifestyle that is portrayed online doesn&#39;t fit the medical model? Then, people may think twice, but obviously, that&#39;s too late.
