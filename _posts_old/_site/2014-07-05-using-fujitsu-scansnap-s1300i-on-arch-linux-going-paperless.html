<p>I have bought a Fujitsu Snapscan S1300i scanner - mainly because it is duplex - it saves a lot of time and will scan directly to Evernote. So far, I'm pleased with it, but the initial thought when I got it home was, 'how am I going to get it working with Arch Linux?'</p>
<p>Fujitsu Scansnap 1300i is supported by Sane, but does require a little bit of tinkering. You need the file 1300i_0D12.nal - which is only available from installing the file on a windows machine. If you wish to download it, you can from here <a title="https://www.dropbox.com/s/saa9fytvbnicwks/1300i_0D12.nal" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/saa9fytvbnicwks/1300i_0D12.nal">https://www.dropbox.com/s/saa9fytvbnicwks/1300i_0D12.nal</a> - put that file in the directory /usr/share/sane/epjitsu (on Arch Linux).</p>
<p>Now, edit the /etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf file - you need to include the settings found at <a title="http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl?manu=fujitsu&amp;model=scansnap&amp;bus=any&amp;v=&amp;p=" href="http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl?manu=fujitsu&amp;model=scansnap&amp;bus=any&amp;v=&amp;p=" target="_blank">http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl?manu=fujitsu&amp;model=scansnap&amp;bus=any&amp;v=&amp;p=</a> 0x04c5/0x128d -</p>
<blockquote><p># Fujitsu S1300i<br />
firmware /usr/share/sane/epjitsu/1300i_0D12.nal<br />
usb 0x04c5 0x128d</p></blockquote>
<p>Once you've done this, you may need to test the config with superuser rights (sudo gscan2pdf).</p>
<p>Running <a title="gscan2pdf" href="http://gscan2pdf.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">gscan2pdf</a> will present you with a choice of scanners - for some reason gscan2pdf picks up my in built camera, which I change to the Fujitsu. To scan duplex you will need to change the settings to standard_tab &gt; scan source_dropdown= ADF- Duplex.</p>
