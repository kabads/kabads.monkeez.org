<p>Dreamt I went on holiday to Poland on top of a container ship, which then sank. I lost my friend Karlos in the wreckage. I swam for shore and then had all my belongings nicked at the local bank. After treating some locals to my credit card and money, I tried to get some money from a bank with just my passport. It didn't go well. Not the best of holidays.</p>
