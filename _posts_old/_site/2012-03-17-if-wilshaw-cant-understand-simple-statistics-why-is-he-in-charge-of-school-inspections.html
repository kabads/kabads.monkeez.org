<p>The chief inspector for standards in schools needs to go back to school and study statistics. This guy doesn't understand that some people will inevitably not achieve the national average, because that's exactly what it is - the average. If everyone achieved the average, then surely the average would lift even higher.</p>
<p>If Wilshaw can't understand this basic concept, why is he in charge of school standards?</p>
