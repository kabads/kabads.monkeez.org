<p>Children becoming addicted to video game fantasy worlds, teachers warn - <a title="monki.biz/2m" href="http://monki.biz/2m">http://monki.biz/2m</a></p>
<p>If parents ignore the age ratings on games, there is nothing that will stop children from playing these games. They are in the same room as the parents and the console is there waiting for them to play it. If a parent is negligible enough to purchase this and leave it lying around, then children will naturally explore what is there.</p>
<p>However, obviously, teachers are not parents. So, why are teachers discussing this at their annual conference? It's because children's use of technology affects their upbringing. If they are immersed in a game, they will find it difficult to think about anything else. They may even start to role-play that game on the playground. This, eventually affects their learning.</p>
<p>But, teachers are not responsible for what goes on in the home - that is the role of the parents. If parents do not take an interest in what their children are accessing in the home, then pupils will be affected by this and their behaviour will be affected in schools.</p>
<p>Parents must start to monitor their children's use of technology. Recently an app came on the itunes store that allowed children to send messages, similar to text messages, on their ipodÂ to other children's ipods. Parents started out thinking that the ipod was not capable of sending text messages. However, they were wrong. Once an item is connected to a network, that device becomes capable of much more than its first use (e.g. ipods were initially used predominantly for gaming).</p>
<p>The reaction from a quick letter out to parents at my school showed how shocked they were that their children could now send text messages. Why were they not interested before this in what the device was capable of? Why is it the school's role to inform the parents about what their child could be up to in the home? Is it because parents are not taking responsibility for what is going on?</p>
<p>Is it also because technology is being used as a temporary baby-sitter, allowing parents to carry on with other activities whilst their child's time is spent on some game or device?</p>
