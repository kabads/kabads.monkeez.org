<p>I felt that this kind of surveillance was already going on, but the latest leak proves it. Apparently, if we haven't done anything wrong, we don't need to be worried. However, I wouldn't be happy showing everyone my bank details, even though I haven't done anything wrong. I just expect privacy as part of being in a 'free' society. William Hague didn't want to divulge any of the secret procedures this morning on TV, but instead he attempted to assure us that the correct 'checks and balances' are in place to protect us. He couldn't discuss what he knew and what he didn't know as that would defeat the secrecy that is required for this. Am I turning in to a tin-foil hat wearing nut? Probably.</p>
