<div class="posterous_autopost">So Posterous has been sold and many people are coming to terms with the high probability that the team have sold out and abandoned the service. This is very similar to <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> when it was sold acquired and then sold by Yahoo! - a disgruntled user was so annoyed by the team that he set up his own service and claimed that it would never be sold. He even asks for payments so that the business model stacks up.

<div>So, is anyone out there prepared to do something similar for posterous? Build a similar service and then charge a smallish fee for it to remain free from corporate (i.e. twitter) ruinations? If not, it&#39;s back to wordpress for me, which doesn&#39;t have the same community feel that posterous provided. </div>
