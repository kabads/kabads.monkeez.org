<div class="posterous_autopost">Rode to work on a motorcycle, without a helmet on (not sure why), stopped by the police who carried out a critical MOT of the bike and then let me go with a warning - they failed to notice lack of the helmet. One actually asked me for a lift to town, and promised to turn a blind eye to the lack of the helmet.  <br />Got to town and worked in some youth scheme doing up an old car workshop area - several very funny people were there (including Dave Evans) who didn&#39;t work and mostly told jokes to each other. No work was carried out. </div>
