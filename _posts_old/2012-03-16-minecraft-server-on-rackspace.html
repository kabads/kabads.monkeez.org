<div class="posterous_autopost">We have minecraft server running 24/7 here at home, which has been running really nicely. We once got caught out by a power failure which corrupted our world (we don&#39;t have a UPS) and the world was pretty advanced. Since then, we were running backups of our world and it was working nicely again. However, I was a little perturbed that this machine was on the whole time. So, after playing around with Amazon EC2 and realising that this wasn&#39;t for us, I decided to look at <a href="http://rackspace.co.uk">rackspace.co.uk</a> - they run small scale servers for a cheap price - £0.02 per hour. You only get billed for the time that the server is running. I&#39;m guessing that this is cheaper than running the server here (as long as we shut the thing down when we&#39;re not using it).

<div>Pros of running the server on rackspace</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m guessing the data is more secure than sat in my house without a machine that is not on a UPS. </li>
<li>Less electricity use</li>
<li>other users who are not on our LAN get a better experience (our ADSL upload is slow)</li>
</ul>
<p /></div>
<div>Cons of running on rackspace</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>slight lag compared to running over our LAN</li>
<li>time taken to create an image of the server, delete it and then get it running takes time - so incidental use is less likely</li>
<li>bandwidth on our ISP is logged, so I will eventually use more bandwidth (I&#39;m not sure how much). </li>
<li>IP address changes every time </li>
</ul>
