      <p>I work in education, but have had a background in computers since 1980s, using my Computing Skills in pretty much every job I have held.</p>

      <p>I'm currently working on sysadmin jobs for particular clients, maintaining their servers and setting up software on internet enabled servers.</p>

<p>      I've been a keen runner for the last 3 years and enjoy getting in some miles at the weekend.</p>

      <p>I also like to read - especially science fiction. </p>
      <p> If you wish to contact me, send me a DM through twitter.</p>

      <p>Currently reading: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/000721801X ">Bernard Cornwell - The Last Kingdom</a>.
