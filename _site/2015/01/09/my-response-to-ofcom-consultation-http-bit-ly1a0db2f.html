<h2 class="content">My response to Ofcom consultation - http:// bit.ly/1A0db2F</h2>
<p> <p>Ofcom have ruled that the Green Party may not take part in Party Election Discussion broadcasts - here's my response - if it's any use - please feel free to post yours at: <a class="short-url" href="http://bit.ly/1A0db2F"><span class="protocol">http://</span> bit.ly/1A0db2F </a></p>
<p>Green party membership is rising and current data may be out of line in May 2015 when the broadcasts are meant to take place.</p>
<p>Ofcom should not try to assess which parties are major before the discussions take place. In this way, they are limiting any party from becoming a major political party.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to define what a major political party is, as a percentage of the electorate may vote for them, but what percentage makes them a major political party? How do you decide the threshold for that party?</p>
<p>No. Ofcom should remain impartial to all party politics and should ensure that broadcasters give a broad range of political party policies. If they continue to decide which parties get Party Election Broadcasts, then they continue to perpetuate the political system that we still have, stifling any change on the political landscape, that a majority of the UK population seem to vioce a concern over.</p>
