<p> <p>I've just got the VPS bug. A VPS is a virtual private server, which means you get root access to a server of your choice at a very low cost (as opposed to a dedicated server).</p>
<p>I've managed to get some pretty cheap deals which manage services that I used to run in my house (using computers up and valuable space).</p>
<p>One of the servers now runs my media and another (my favourite) runs minecraft (<a title="www.monkeez.co.uk/latest-map" href="http://www.monkeez.co.uk/latest-map">www.monkeez.co.uk/latest-map</a> if you're interested in the world that is being played in - note the tree house in the jungle area).</p>
<p>These things are very reliable and have a lot more bandwidth than my home ADSL connection, which means I can run things constantly without having to worry about the connection at home.</p>
<p>Currently I'm using <a title="www.buyvm.net" href="http://www.buyvm.net">www.buyvm.net</a>Â to host a minecraft server (with all the nginx webserver in the background). They seem very stable and are easy to setup and pay for.</p>
<p>I'm also using another vps host (no names mentioned here) to host my media which has extremely fast connection).</p>
<p>Overall, this is a good way of managing services that have to run the whole time and need a lot of configuration.</p>
