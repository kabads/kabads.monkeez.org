<p>Publishing is a tough industry to be in, no doubt about it. Things are rapidly changing and market forces are being swayed beyond the traditional publisher's influence. Things are now so easy to share and distribute, that these old gate-keepers can no longer steer what people are looking at.</p>
<p>However, e-books are being subjected to this, so that instead of paper being pushed around and controlled, &nbsp;instead digital files are being controlled and again, authors are being expected to go through the publisher, instead of dealing directly with their audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article (monki.biz/1r) &nbsp;deals with these issues and in an attempt to educate people, perhaps try and free them from the constraints of big business so that they can start to author themselves more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worse still, is the new apple iauthor software from apple, which will allow the writer to only release their writing through itunes - creepy or what?</p>
