<p>Read this (<a href="http://monki.biz/1w)">http://monki.biz/1w)</a> article and bash those teachers. It seems to me that every time someone pronounces the next educational revolution, they never use any research or scientific reasoning behind their proposals, which will actually show a benefit to the state education system.</p>
<p>By enforcing a national curriculum, teachers are robbed of creativity, thus boring pupils and creating an uninspiring teaching experience.</p>
<p>By paying teachers less, you remove the incentive in talented people joining the profession.</p>
<p>By measuring performance by state tests, you are testing something that doesn't relate to the real world and doesn't help prepare children for future working situations.</p>
<p>Only by handing over the control of the state education system to an impartial body can we truly de-politicise this important organisation that raises future generations. Until politicians drop their reins of control, this will continue - however, their power hungry attitude will mean that we will face new task-masters in five years time who have different attitudes and will run a national experiment on how to educate our newest generation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Will Hutton, he will probably continue to see arcane solutions for modern day problems and will probably be grabbing headlines, unless he takes his pension, that is.</p>
