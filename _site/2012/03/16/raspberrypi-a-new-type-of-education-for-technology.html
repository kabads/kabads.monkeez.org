<h2 class="content">RaspberryPi - a new type of education for technology?</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p> <div class="posterous_autopost">When I was at school we had a Commodore PET and about six BBC Micros. The class size was pretty small and children learned how to run programs and then write their own programs. There wasn&#39;t a great range of programs. 
<p />
<div>Today sees the launch of the RaspberryPi which is a small micro processing board, with USB and video out functionality - which pretty much acts as a computer. This is an attempt to engage children on the same level as I was 30 years ago. I&#39;m not sure how this is going to go in school as things have changed a lot. I&#39;m already worried that it may be too late for children to engage with technology at a hackers level, but instead they&#39;ve been exposed to the glitzy graphics that comes with a playstation console game. For them to experience something similar to Scratch and then write their own simple 2D game may be a little laughable. Sure, some will be enamoured with it, but I&#39;m not sure it will be as many as we hope. If very interesting things can be done with it, then I think children will come to this new media - but when I say cool, I mean unusual technology, not necessarily graphical games or code. </div>
<p />
<div>For example, if the raspberrypi were to monitor the environment and then act on that, possibly online, via social networking - or if the card could be used to integrate digital technology around the school more, instead of being solely used in the ICT suite, then it may gain more popularity. It would be cool to implement it along side a more portable screen, so that it could be moved around more, along with a portable power supply. This sort of device would become more similar to a mobile phone, which is now already in the hands of many children and teenagers, and is very functional - so this might not be required. </div>
<p />
<div>All in all, this little device has to create a reputation that is above and beyond the competing technologies that are already out there. </div>
