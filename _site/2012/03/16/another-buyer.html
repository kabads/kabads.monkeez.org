<h2 class="content">Another buyer</h2>
<p> <div class="posterous_autopost">
<p>Report easy has another buyer - who purchased it yesterday. I was surprised when I got my first buy, but have been surprised that other people have joined in. It's early days and I've still made a loss on the whole venture, but the fact that people think my software has real value that they are prepared to pay for, is even more surprising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put up a video on youtube of the video to show people what it looks like when they are using it, which I think is the selling point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I need to keep on developing this and rolling it out to people who have already bought it.&nbsp;</p>
