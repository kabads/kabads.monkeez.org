<p>He's using private email to try and cover his tracks. He currently believes that by using his private email system, any requests under Freedom of Information, will be refused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this mean that he has something to hide? What kind of discussions are going on between Gove and his department officials? I would be interested to find out.</p>
