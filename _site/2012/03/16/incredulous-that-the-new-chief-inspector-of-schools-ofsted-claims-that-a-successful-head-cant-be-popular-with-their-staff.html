<p>This statement is a complete draconian statement and reveals that Michael Wilshaw doesn't have an adequate level of professionalism to run Ofsted. The Guardian questions whether the chief inspector of schools is now just a puppet for the government - with the claim that Michael Gove has appointed someone who matches the political agenda for Government. That certainly seems to fit the bill with the way that Wilshaw ran his school whilst head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wilshaw widened his catchment area so much that he was pulling in motivated children from the other schools - 40% of the school's pupils came from further than 1km away from the school.</p>
<p>Read the article and make your mind up - but the days of an education system being distanced from state seem further away than ever before with this new appointment. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Michael Wilshaw, the new Ofsted chief, comes with a reputation as a 'heroic' head, but is he now just an instrument of government, unsympathetic to schools more challenging than his?</span></p>
