<p>Since posterous announced they have been acquired by twitter, I and  many others, have been thinking that posterous may not be around for  much longer. The FAQ posted makes reference to the team now working on  twitter products and how they will announce details of exporting your  data out of posterous when/if the time comes that the service will  change. This is not looking good, so I made the decision to switch back  to wordpress. Posterous has been good, but free is price does not mean  that you get the best service in the long term. However, with wordpress,  you get exactly the service that you create. So, I've installed plugins  to wordpress in an attempt to recreate the service they offer.</p></p>
<div>I  managed to set up my posterous account (luckily, I didn't have that  many posts) to autopost to my new wordpress blog. Unfortunately,  posterous doesn't yet offer an export tool, apart from the autopost.  They took 15 days to create 15 import tools - (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/jul/12/posterous-wordpress?INTCMP=SRCH" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/jul/12/posterous-wordpress?INTCMP=SRCH</a>) -&nbsp;how long will they take to create 15 export tools?</div></p>
<div>Initially,  I liked posting by email, so I looked at the plugins. The original  install of wordpress already has this function, but there are other  plugins that extend this much further than the default install. So I  found a plugin called Postie - (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/postie/changelog/" target="_blank">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/postie/changelog/</a>)  - this plugin looked great, but it seems that people have had problems  installing this on my webhost - so I had to give up. Instead, I've gone  with the default install which means I don't get to post inline images -  something Postie offered. I set up a gmail account with a random string  of letters prefixed by my blog title and then configured wordpress to  check that email address (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_to_your_blog_using_email" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_to_your_blog_using_email</a>). I also had to set up a cron job to check the&nbsp;<a href="http://mywebsite.com/wp-mail.php" target="_blank">http://mywebsite.com/wp-mail.php</a>&nbsp;file so that I didn't have to browse that address every time - 1,16,31,46 /usr/bin/wget -N&nbsp;<a href="http://mydomain.com/wp-mail.php" target="_blank">http://mydomain.com/wp-mail.php</a>&nbsp;does this for me every 15 minutes.&nbsp;</div></p>
<div>Next, I installed the Twitter Tools plugin (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/" target="_blank">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/</a>)  which integrates wordpress with twitter. This was the trickiest to set  up, but for an advanced user, it isn't that bad. You configure the  plugin by creating an app for your twitter account. When you do this,  you create a&nbsp;Consumer Key, Consumer Secret,&nbsp;Access Token and Access  Token secret. Feed these strings in to your plugin settings and then  your accounts will synchronise. You can then create blog posts from  twitter posts and twitter posts from blog posts - very similar to  posterous.</div></p>
<div>Instead of relying on a now  unreliable service, I've managed to free my posts. The only downside  currently is that I cannot use inline images in email to post. I've yet  to set up things like scribd documents, but I hardly used those anyway.  Posterous never worked when exporting to my picasa account - I will try  this next with wordpress. If you've got any other tips, please post in  the replies.</div>
