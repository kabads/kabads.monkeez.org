    <p> <p>Spent a very interesting afternoon with <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/archaeology/about/staff/m-g-fulford.aspx">Professor Fulford</a> around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silchester">Silchester</a> with a group of teachers. He was very informative about the site and helped us describe what it would have been like for Romans living there. We discussed different uses for the Ampitheatre, which had 10 feet high walls, which would have been used for gladiators to fight each other or bears.
We also discussed the ramparts which were built before the town stone walls, in a hurry, in less than a year due to the Romans not leaving a great military contingeny back in the South of England. Parts of human skulls have been found at the town gates, probably hung up as a sign to anyone who was thinking of causing problems as they entered the town.</p>

<p>He proudly displayed the 500 years in a metre of soil, which had different layers of agriculture, through to buildings (with foundations). The coolest find this year is a dog’s paw print in a roof tile. He seemed to think that the dogs that the Atrebatems had were a lot larger than the pet dogs we have now.</p>

<p>We then saw the recent small-finds box, with glass beads and iron age pins for decoration. The sad news is that this dig is closing in 4 weeks and being filled in (they have reached layers before there was any settlement there). If you’re local, get down while it’s all on public display.</p>
