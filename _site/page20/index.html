          Cameron and the &quot;massive redistribution of power&quot;. Yeah, right.
        </a>
      </h3><p>Back in 2009 Cameron vowed to open government to the masses ("We will begin a massive redistribution of power in our country, from the powerful to the powerless, from the political elite to the man and the woman in the street." - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8067505.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8067505.stm</a>) and yet he refuses to disclose which big donors have been for dinner - (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17508271">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17508271</a>).</p>
<p>Is this really the "massive redistribution of power" that we were expecting? Do we really now feel this redistribution of power? Or, alternatively, those with money have the right to meet with senior politicians and try to influence policy?</p>

          Tried Edmodo - like it
        </a>
      </h3><p>I introduced <a title="Edmodo" href="http://www.edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> to my ICT club this afternoon and they enjoyed it. Basically, it's an online learning environment that is private to you and your groups. You give your children a code when they sign up which enrols them on your course automatically. The children found it difficult to find a username that hadn't already been chosen, but after some perseverance they all got on, children from year 3 to year 6.</p>
<p>Their first activity was to upload a file as a response to an assignment. Some younger children had problems doing this, but the other children got in to it instantly and I gave them feedback. They also took a vote on whether Edmodo was a good thing and over 80% were in favour.</p>
