I'm afraid, I'm shamelessly using github to store my website. It's embarrassing, but github is so cool and useful that it just works. 

I'm using [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) on a great, but extremely cheap webhost, which is pulling this from github automatically and then publishing it.  

I'm also using git to push this directly to the great webhost.
