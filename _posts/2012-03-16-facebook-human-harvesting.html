<div class="posterous_autopost">The film soylent green is about people being harvested for food. That&#39;s how I see Facebook. Your details are being harvested for business and advertising. Sure, it can be beneficial to stay in touch with each other, but there&#39;s a bigger price to pay. I&#39;ve come to the decision that the amount of information I&#39;m getting from other people isn&#39;t worth the price I&#39;m paying for that lack of privacy and having my details flogged to advertisers. 
<p />
<div>So, I&#39;ve made a deal with myself to give up on facebook and see how it goes for a month. I&#39;m not going to log in or check any status updates from facebook. However, I will continue to get stuff from twitter and blogs as they really offer interesting stuff. </div>
<p />
<div>So, if you&#39;ve stumbled here instead and we were friends on facebook, please don&#39;t take it personally, I just don&#39;t like being harvested.
