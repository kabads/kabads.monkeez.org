Nicky Morgan has finally admitted that she recognises that teachers are now burdened with beauracracy. In an article in the [Telegraph](http://bit.ly/1GTw3mN) she says that teachers shouldn't be checking their email after 5pm. However, I'm not sure when teachers will be able to check them.

Teachers struggle to get the amount of work done, plus their teaching commitment during the day. It will be interesting to see how she proposes that this is will work.
