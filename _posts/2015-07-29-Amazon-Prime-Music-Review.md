Amazon yesterday released the prime music service in the UK. This came at a particularly useful time for me as I'm currently not working and so have quite a bit of time to play with it. I have used spotify in the past, but not regularly as I don't get as much time to listen to music as I would like.

The web interface immediately pushed me to their playlists, which this service seems to rely on heavily. The reason for that becomes apparent later on, due to the availability of 1 million tracks. Spotify claims to offer 30 million tracks and so Amazon is at a disadvantage here.
