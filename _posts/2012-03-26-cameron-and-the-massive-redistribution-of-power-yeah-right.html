<p>Back in 2009 Cameron vowed to open government to the masses ("We will begin a massive redistribution of power in our country, from the powerful to the powerless, from the political elite to the man and the woman in the street." - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8067505.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8067505.stm</a>) and yet he refuses to disclose which big donors have been for dinner - (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17508271">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17508271</a>).</p>
<p>Is this really the "massive redistribution of power" that we were expecting? Do we really now feel this redistribution of power? Or, alternatively, those with money have the right to meet with senior politicians and try to influence policy?</p>
