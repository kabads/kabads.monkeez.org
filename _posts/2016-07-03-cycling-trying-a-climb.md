This afternoon, I met up with a few friends at a local pub. It was great catching up with everyone, but what also great was that afterwards, I planned to cycle some 15km to one of the largest hills around. I wanted to see what it was like to climb roughly 150m up a hill. And find out, I did. I didn't quite make it all the way to the top without stopping, but I got to the top with one break just near the top. Needless to say, I will be going back to see how I fare next time.
