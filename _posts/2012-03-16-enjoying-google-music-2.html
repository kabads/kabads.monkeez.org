<div class="posterous_autopost">
<p>I've signed up to google music - not sure if I like the way spotify is going. I don't like having to have a facebook account (not that I had one when I initially signed up) and I don't like the way spotify are going about publishing details about my music preferences even though I haven't signed up for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for a while - goodbye spotify and hello google music.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
