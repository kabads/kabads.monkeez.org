<div class="posterous_autopost">
<p>This podcast (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bmrkt">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bmrkt</a>) had people appearing defending and arguing against the current monarchy in the UK. One of the most powerful points made was the amount of bias that the monarchy receives pretty much throughout the whole media. We are at a place where they are mostly unquestionable and allowed to behave without any accountability.&nbsp;</p></p>
<div>The BBC are currently promoting their programme The Diamond Queen, which looks like it will fall in to this exact category - a piece promoting the good works that the current monarch carries out in our country without any questioning about how that system works. The moral maze raised the question that we, as a democratic nation) have no say in who is head of state - and even the&nbsp;panellists&nbsp;who claimed to support democratic values, felt uncomfortable at that thought.&nbsp;</div></p>
