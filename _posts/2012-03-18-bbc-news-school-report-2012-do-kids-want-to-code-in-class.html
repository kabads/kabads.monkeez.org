<p>Technology is central to most young people's lives, but there is a disconnect between how they use it at home and how they are taught it.</p>
<p>via <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17373972">BBC News - School Report 2012: Do kids want to code in class?</a>.</p>
<p>This is a nice piece about the current discussion about school's ICT curriculum. Children do need to connect much more closely with the technology around them so that they understand what software and devices do behind the scenes. They are often quick to pick up functionality, but that's just through familiarity, not really to do with how this stuff actually works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>A child this week told me that he knew loads about the internet and computers. I asked him what DNS meant - he didn't have a clue. While my question was loaded and he was young, hopefully he'll go away now and look that up and learn about one of the most important technologies that lies behind the web, that an awful lot of people take for granted. I'm still waiting for my answer right now though.</p>
