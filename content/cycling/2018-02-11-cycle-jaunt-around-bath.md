A train ride on a Sunday morning and I'm in Bath cycling the Two Tunnels circuit. Highly recommended. The Tunnels are dimly lit, but have enough space to avoid each other. The pub at the end of the Tunnels (https://www.facebook.com/hopeandanchormidford/)[The Hope and Anchor] serves great coffee and offers a little rest from the elements.
