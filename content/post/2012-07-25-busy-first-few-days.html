<p>Ordered a camera and started using it (or trying to use it).<br />
Got a top box on the car (with roof bars).<br />
Put the tent up and fixed it.<br />
Took stuff to the dump.<br />
Sorted out some duff bank accounts.<br />
Sorted out a credit card.<br />
Walked in the forest (and got muddy jumping over a stream).<br />
Switched broadband provider.<br />
Lots and lots of gardening (mostly weeding).<br />
Met up with mum and had her birthday lunch.<br />
Lots of fun stuff on minecraft.<br />
Painting water paints.<br />
Painting the hall (including buying all the materials).<br />
Got a paddling pool, filled it up and splashed around.</p>
