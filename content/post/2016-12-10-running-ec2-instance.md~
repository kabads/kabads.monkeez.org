Amazon have provided a pretty neat infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). By using this as a platform, you can quickly scale up and down provisioned resources. At times, you may experience peak demand, and AWS will allow you to respond with this. At other times, you can scale your resources down.

The first step in learning about this platform, is running an EC2 instance. This is the 'machine' behind your service. It will hold CPU/RAM and storage resources. Depending on your requirements, you can choose different types of EC2 instances.
