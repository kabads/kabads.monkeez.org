title: Linux group explained
---
Users on a linux system belong to at least one group. Groups allow a systems administrator to create parts of the filesystem where a group of users can share files. They also allow a group of users to access particular commands or resources on the system, that other users might not be able to access.

Groups are defined in the **/etc/group** file, which is only root writeable.

To create a group, the **groupadd** command is used.

    $ groupadd test

will add a group called test. This will automatically set gid (a numerical value for the group's ID).
