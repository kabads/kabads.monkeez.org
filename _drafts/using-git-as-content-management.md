title: Using Git as a content management system
---
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open sourced source control software system. It allows coders to manage large projects remotely and on their own machine. Each contributor will hold their own version of the code on their machine and can manipulate that however they wish. Eventually, they can push back their contributions to a remote repository.

This workflow design is also great for managing content, although that content does have to be in text format - git will allow binary files to be uploaded and managed, but doesn't allow for differences between files to be shown - this can only be done with plain text files.
