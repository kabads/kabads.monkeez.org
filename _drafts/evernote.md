I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) a lot in my work and to help me manage the information that I receive via email. Evernote helps me index everything and categorise different projects that I'm working on. I typically have 20 clients that I'm looking after at any one time and so being able to call up information about each one is vital to me. I do not have access to a customer relations database at work and so have created my own within Evernote. 

When I receive an email, I work out what I need to do with it. Is it actionable now, or would it be better posted away for the future. If I can action it now (and it will take less than two minutes), then I do that. If not, then I post it in to Evernote. My email system is integrated with Out
