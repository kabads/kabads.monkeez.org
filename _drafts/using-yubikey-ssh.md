title: Using Yubikey to Login to SSH
category: sysadmin

[Yubikey](http://yubico.com) is a [one-time-password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) authentication key. It plugs in to a USB port and becomes a keyboard that produces one time passwords. When combined with SSH this provides a very secure way of using passwords with SSH (although still not as secure as public/private key authentication).
