title: Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin 201 review 

---

The course is available online or face to face. This review is based on the resources online and the resources available there. 

### Course breakdown

The topics covered are very relevant to Linux sysadmin tasks and the exam is task based. You receive a shell in a browser window with a pane telling you to complete a particular objective. You then click on to the next objective. Each objective does not rely on previous ones but there are some that help (one in particular asks you to back up some files that you end up working on later on - that backup *may* become useful).

Documentation covers, the boot sequence, filesystem, kernel and modules, partitioning, logical volume management, raid, package management and installation, process monitoring, user account management, file permissions, basic networking, backup and recovery and firewalls. You will also need to cover part of the free [edx](http://www.edx.org) course that comes up. Some people may be surprised by this and so covering it is advised.

### Activities

Most courses end with a PDF file that you download and work through a particular user case (e.g. setting up a raid configuration). This is covered out in a virtual machine. The activities are easy to follow through although there were some errors in a couple of chapters when I went through it. You will need to become a good master of the __man__ command as this will help you out. When you take the exam at the end of the course, you are expected to use all the resources on the machine and to go online breaks the exam expectations.

### Examination
You log on to a machine through a browser. Your proctor sets you up via a shared text chat area to the left. They may ask you to pan your camera around the room and next to you to check that you have no reference materials. You are expected to stay in the same space for the duration of the exam, which is 2 hours, so ensure you go to the toilet and get a drink before you start. Once you have started, you don't have to keep the chat window open. There is another pane which gives you instructions of what to do on the virtual machine and then a next button. You don't have to complete the tasks in order, but it can be advisable. It's a good idea to keep a record of which one's you have completed and which ones you need to go back to. This is typcial examination technique and not speicific to LFS201.
