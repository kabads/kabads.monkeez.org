## Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin Course 201

The course is available online or face to face. This review is based on the resources online and the resources available there.

### Course breakdown

The topics covered are very relevant to Linux sysadmin tasks and the exam is task based. You receive a shell in a browser window with a pane telling you to complete a particular objective. You then click on to the next objective. Each objective does not rely on previous ones but there are some that help (one in particular asks you to back up some files that you end up working on later on - that backup *may* become useful).

Documentation covers, the boot sequence, filesystem, kernel and modules, partitioning, logical volume management, raid, package management and installation, process monitoring, user account management, file permissions, basic networking, backup and recovery and firewalls. You will also need to cover part of the free [edx](http://www.edx.org) course that comes up. Some people may be surprised by this and so covering it is advised.

### Activities

Most courses end with a PDF file that you download and work through a particular user case (e.g. setting up a raid configuration). This is covered out in a virtual machine.
