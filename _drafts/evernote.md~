title: Evernote productivity

I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) a lot in my work and to help me manage the information that I receive via email. Evernote helps me index everything and categorise different projects that I'm working on. I typically have 20 clients that I'm looking after at any one time and so being able to call up information about each one is vital to me. I do not have access to a customer relations database at work and so have created my own within Evernote.
